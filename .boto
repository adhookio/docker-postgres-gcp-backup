# This file contains credentials and other configuration information needed
# by the boto library, used by gsutil. You can edit this file (e.g., to add
# credentials) but be careful not to mis-edit any of the variable names (like
# "gs_access_key_id") or remove important markers (like the "[Credentials]" and
# "[Boto]" section delimiters).
#
# You can create additional configuration files by running
# gsutil config [options] [-o <config-file>]

# following line:
#gs_oauth2_refresh_token = <your OAuth2 refresh token>
